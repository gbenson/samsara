Improvements
============
 - make xml.context cache documents during spidering for speed.
 - try using mmap in the FileHandler for speed
 - some functions/classes are missing docstrings.
 - need to formalize some kind of directory for code common to XPath
   extensions and user handlers.
 - util.date is pretty much inauspicious.org specific and should be
   moved into the above common directory.
 - make util.loader traverse into modules, reloading modules of
   modules?
 - move __strptime from the various XPath extensions into wherever
   util.date ends up.
